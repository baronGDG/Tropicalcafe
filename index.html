            Caffè Americano (also known as Americano or American; Italian pronunciation: [kafˈfɛ ameriˈkaːno]; Spanish: café
            americano, literally American coffee) is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving
            it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies
            with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization
            and use of diacritics: e.g., café americano

            Caffe latte (or simply latte) is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. 
            
            In northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term café au lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso
            and milk. In France, café latte is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caffè latte or caffelatte);
            a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a "latte" is in French called grand crème and in German
            Milchkaffee or (in Austria) Wiener Melange.
            
            Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai
            (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also
            used.

            A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is traditionally prepared with steamed milk
            foam (microfoam).
            
            Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milks, and flavoring with cinnamon or
            chocolate powder.[2][3] It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.[4]
            
            The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,[5] and in this context referring to
            the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee[6] (today mostly espresso). The
            physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the
            drink.
            
            The Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner", possibly in the 18th century, on a version that included whipped cream and
            spices of unknown origin.

        <p>
            Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in
            which a small amount of nearly boiling water (about 90 °C or 190 °F) is forced under 9–10 bars (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150
            psi) of atmospheric pressure (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide
            variety of coffee beans and roast degrees. Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern Europe,
            especially in Italy, Spain, Portugal and France.
            
            Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity of warm honey. This is due to the
            higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[1] As a
            result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated.
            of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.
